# Diamond_price_prediction

 A diamond retailer wants to predict the price of diamonds based on various features such as ,carat,cut,color,clarity,depth,table,x,y and z, in order to optimize pricing and improve sales.
 
 The retailer has collected a dataset of over 50,000 diamonds, including information on the diamond's carat weight, color, clarity, cut, depth percentage, table percentage, price, and other features. This dataset will be used to train and test machine learning models.
 
The dataset will be cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical features such as color and cut.
 
Machine learning algorithms such as XGBRegressor and random forests will be tested and evaluated for their performance in predicting diamond prices. The best-performing model will be selected. The selected model will be evaluated using performance metric such as mean absolute error.
