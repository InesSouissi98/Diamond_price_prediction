# Diamond price prediction

 A diamond retailer wants to predict the price of diamonds based on various features such as carat,cut,color,clarity,depth,table,x,y and z  in order to optimize pricing and improve sales.
 
 The retailer has collected a dataset of diamonds, including information on the diamond's carat weight, color, clarity, cut, depth percentage, table percentage, price, and other features. This dataset will be used to train and test machine learning models.
 
The dataset will be cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical features such as color and cut.
 
Machine learning algorithms such as XGBRegressor and random forest will be tested and evaluated for their performance in predicting diamond prices. The best-performing model will be selected. The selected model will be evaluated using performance metric such as mean absolute error.

**Tools:** <br >
Programming language: Python <br >
Data preprocessing and analysis libraries: Pandas and NumPy. <br >
data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. <br >
Machine learning algorithms: XGBRegressor and random forest. <br >
